# Eco Skills Requirements

This mod allows you to configure requirements for skills, so when a user wants to learn it by spending a star, he will have to:
- already have some other skills
- not have some skills
- wait before a specific day
- spend more or less than 1 star

As an admin you can run a command to allow some specific user to bypass these requirements.

## Commands

> /SkillsRequirements
  > /SkillsRequirements Toggle true?                     : Disable or Enable the mod. Add true if you want to save this change in the config file.
  > /SkillsRequirements AllowBypass User, skillName      : Allow a player to bypass requirements of a skill (He will still need the custom amont of stars, if set)
  > /SkillsRequirements DisallowBypass User, skillName   : Disallow a player to bypass requirements of a skill
